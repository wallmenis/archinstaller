# archinstaller
My personal arch installation script (WIP)
Really nothing special to see here. It will generally do the same things as the default archinstall will do but through bash.
Meant to resolve some quirks I don't like with archinstall (mainly when choosing to encrypt the drive to encrypt the root filesystem instead of the home one)
